# Multi-Vendor Marketplace MVP

## This Project is Live!
https://multi-vendor-marketplace-mvp.vercel.app/

## Overview

This project demonstrates how I design and build **production-style marketplace platforms** for real users, real data, and real business workflows.

Many teams outgrow no-code tools or generic plugins when they need custom roles, messaging, payments, and search logic. This marketplace MVP shows how those requirements can be implemented cleanly and extended over time.

The system is suitable for startups, internal business platforms, or custom marketplaces that require flexibility beyond off-the-shelf solutions.

## Core Capabilities

### User Roles & Authentication

- Secure authentication and authorization
- Buyer and seller role separation
- Role-based dashboards and access control

### Listings & Marketplace Logic

- Create, update, and manage listings
- Ownership-based permissions
- Structured data models designed for scalability

### Messaging

- Built-in user-to-user chat between buyers and sellers
- Conversation-based messaging tied to listings
- Designed to support moderation or admin oversight if needed

### Search (AI-Assisted)

- Intelligent search layer to surface relevant listings
- Supports keyword-based and semantic-style matching
- Designed to improve relevance as data volume grows

### Payments

- Stripe payment integration for traditional checkout flows
- Crypto payment support for Web3-enabled use cases
- Payment logic isolated for extensibility and security

### Dashboards

- Role-specific dashboards for buyers and sellers
- Clear data presentation for listings, messages, and activity
- Built to support future analytics and admin tooling

## Common Use Cases

This type of system is commonly used for:

- Product or service marketplaces
- Startup MVPs and SaaS prototypes
- Internal company exchanges or portals
- Platforms requiring custom payment and messaging workflows

---

## Technical Overview

- Frontend: React / Next.js (App Router)
- Backend: Next.js Server Actions & route handlers (no separate Node API server)
- Database: PostgreSQL for relational data, Google Cloud Platform for large files and images
- Authentication: Better Auth (role-based authentication & session management)
- Payments: Stripe for fiat payments, Thirdweb and Alchemy for crypto payments
- Search: AI-assisted search layer using OpenAI embeddings and PostgreSQL vector search

The architecture uses **server-side actions co-located with UI** for clearer data flow and faster iteration, while maintaining strong separation between client and server logic.

## If This Were Extended for a Client

Typical next steps would include:

- Improving AI-search relevance using usage data
- Adding reviews, ratings, or reputation systems
- Expanding admin tools and moderation controls
- Strengthening edge-case handling and security
- Integrating live marketplace analytics for products

## About This Project

This repository demonstrates how I approach **full-stack web application development** for client work. The focus is on building systems that are realistic, maintainable, and ready to grow.

If you are building a marketplace, MVP, or internal platform with similar requirements, this project reflects how I would approach your system end-to-end.
